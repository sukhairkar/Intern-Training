        <p>The 2025 Pahalgam attack was a terrorist attack on tourists by five armed terrorists near Pahalgam in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir in which 26 civilians were killed on 22 April 2025.[2][4][5] The militants mainly targeted Hindu tourists, though a Christian tourist and a local Muslim were also killed.[2][6][7] The attackers, armed with M4 carbines and AK-47s, entered the tourist spot in Baisaran Valley surrounded by dense pine forests.[8] This incident is considered the deadliest attack on civilians in India since the 2008 Mumbai attacks.[9][10]
The Resistance Front (TRF), which is believed to be an offshoot of Pakistan-based, UN-designated, Islamist terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT),[11][12][13][14] initially claimed responsibility for the attack.[15] TRF released a statement that the attack was in opposition to non-local settlement in the region resulting from the abolition of the special status of Kashmir.[13] After few days, TRF denied its involvement in the attack.[16] Previously, TRF has claimed responsibility for several attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir targetting religious minorities.</p>

        <p id="messi">Lionel Messi scored twice and created two more as Inter Miami warmed up for the Club World Cup in style with a 5-1 win over the Columbus Crew in Major League Soccer on Saturday. Miami will open the new FIFA tournament on June 14 against Egyptian and African champions Al Ahly and after a major dip in form they have found their touch again in their last two MLS games. A 4-2 win over Montreal in midweek, with Messi and Luis Suarez scoring two goals each, eased the tensions around Javier Mascherano's team and their renewed confidence was evident from the outset.</p>
